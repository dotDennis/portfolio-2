    introduction: "As the end of last school year came to an end, we were challenged with the task of creating a fictional blog. The project was required to use the Wordpress REST API as an headless CMS for content. This was defintely my most technically difficult website to date. The website used no framework, I therefor had to write every of code with my bare hands - heavily advancing my coding knowledge.",
    features_intro: "This website has extremely detailed SEO optimisation, to reward the website with a higher search engine priority. My portfolio follows the same standards as done here, with the exception of a few improvements here & there",
    feature_title_0: "REST API",
    feature_desc_0: "This website is built entirely around the usage of Wordpress REST API, including the contact form & all posts.",
    feature_title_1: "SEO Optimized",
    feature_desc_1: "Accessibility is no issue for this website, it's got it all covered. The website performes alright, as I've learnt there are opportunities for more improvement on loading speed, hence why my portfolio loads so quickly!",
    feature_title_2: "Contact",
    feature_desc_2: "The contact form on my blog page is the same I'm using on this site. Using relative information from where that email is sent from, I'm able to differ my blog & portfolio. It's a solid form that sends me an email directly. It's also built with the use of REST API.",

    introduction: "A stable website with great loading time & SEO. The site is static and features no API. Does contain several placeholder pages, but was created before my days of javascript & offers a solid understanding of how I organize my code & optimize my site.",
    features_intro: "The site is mainly focused on design. A while after I completed the site, I went back to update accessibility and SEO optimizing.",
    feature_title_0: "Loading time",
    feature_desc_0: "The site loads nearly instantly on a solid machine & connection. Without an API connected, image optimization is extremely important. All images has been compressed & shrunk to fit under a max-limit of 200kb, some are even smaller. All this, but still maintaining image quality.",
    feature_title_1: "Accessibility",
    feature_desc_1: "To this date, it's my most accessible website, featuring a ton of labels, titles & what not - to aid assistant programs.",

    source_url: "https://github.com/dotDennis/Gamehub-2.0",
    introduction: "The first 'fully' working website I've made, which has truly shown. I came back to this project around half a year after completing it, and just wanted to cry. The project was a complete mess. Rewrote half of the website's code & optimized the website with an API & updated several other features.",
    features_intro: "The site now features a list of products from an API & is dynamically able to differ items with several clever techniques. Data attributes may commonly be found on the webiste, as well as parameters in the search bar.",
    feature_title_0: "Shopping cart",
    feature_desc_0: "This is one of the few projects I've made with a fully working shopping cart. It updates in real time, with real products. As a version 1 of my shopping cart experience, it's definitely something to be proud of, but still, it has it's flaws.",
    feature_title_1: "Search bar",
    feature_desc_1: "The site also features a search bar, that can sort on nearly anything. The description, title, category, price - almost anything that's related to the games.",
    feature_title_2: "Accessibility",
    feature_desc_2: "You might start to see a trend with my projects at this point. Accessibility is imporant for me, and should be for you. Without accessibility you'll lose a large portion of visitors, and engines like google won't recommend your site as often. It's something I didn't do in this project the first time around, but got around to after a while.",
